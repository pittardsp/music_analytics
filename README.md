This is in support of my Youtube video(s). The primary source for
this information is www.musicwatchinc.com http://www.riaa.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/MusicWatch-Consumer-Profile-2017.pdf

There is also some R code I wrote (very hastily) to scrape the above URL
and convert it into data frames suitable for creating bar charts with the plotlypackage. I wrote the code in about 20 minutes so it is very much "raw" code that could use a lot of cleaning up. 

The two main files are .html files: gender.html and age.html These are the
files I load in the video. The file music_watch.pdf is the image I show in the video which describes the top 3 types of music categories (e.g. Classic rock, Rap, Alternative, etc) for each of the Consumer categories ("CD_BUYERS". "DOWNLOADERS",etc)
